Everyone Is Doing AI Now… and It’s Bullshit. Right now, it feels like everyone is doing AI. Every job post, every resume, every course—it’s all about LLMs, transformers, deep learning. And for entry-level data scientists? It’s making things worse.

Here’s the truth: If you’re trying to break into data science, focusing on AI first is a waste of time. Before you even think about deep learning or generative AI, you need to master the foundations—because most entry-level data scientist roles don’t require AI at all.

### 1 - Data Analytics

Your first job as a data scientist will require you to work with data —not training a GPT-4 model -> 80% of your job will be data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

✅  **SQL** – Extract, manipulate, and analyze structured data efficiently.

✅  **Python (Pandas/Numpy)** – Perform data wrangling, preprocessing, and numerical computations.

✅  **Data Visualization** – Use tools like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Tableau to communicate insights clearly.

If you can’t take raw data, clean it, and extract meaningful insights, **you’re not ready for machine learning yet.**

### 2 - Understand Basic Machine Learning

Instead of jumping into deep learning, start with:

✅  **Regression Models** – Learn **Linear Regression** for predicting numerical values and **Logistic Regression** for classification problems.

✅  **Tree-Based Models** – Understand how **Decision Trees, Random Forest, and XGBoost** can handle complex patterns in data.

✅  **Clustering & Classification** – Explore **K-Means, KNN, and Support Vector Machines (SVMs)** to segment and classify data.

**More importantly, learn when to use these models.** Most businesses don’t need AI—they need effective, data-driven decision-making.

### 3 - Work on End-to-End Projects

A strong project doesn’t just have a model—it answers a real question with real data.

✅  **Data Sourcing:** Collect raw data from APIs, databases, or web scraping.

✅  **Data Cleaning & Feature Engineering:** Handle missing values, create meaningful features, and prepare data for modelling.

✅  **Modelling & Interpretation:** Train models, evaluate their performance, and understand their business impact.

✅  **Storytelling & Visualisation:** Present insights in a compelling way through dashboards, reports, or presentations.

The best projects **show real impact**—not just fancy algorithms. Businesses care about results, not just complex models.
